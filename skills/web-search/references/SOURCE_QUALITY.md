# Source Quality Rubric

## Credibility tiers
Tier 1 (best):
- Official documentation, standards bodies, government or NGO reports.
- Peer-reviewed papers.
- Original press releases or court documents.

Tier 2:
- Reputable journalism and major technical publishers.
- Industry analysts with transparent methodology.

Tier 3 (use cautiously):
- Blogs, forums, personal posts.
- Community wikis without citations.

Avoid:
- Content farms, affiliate spam, scraped aggregators.
- Unverifiable social posts for factual claims.

## Freshness vs authority
- Breaking news: freshness matters, but prefer reputable outlets.
- How something works: authoritative documentation beats newer blog posts.
- Claims with numbers: confirm with primary sources.

## Conflict handling
- If sources conflict, show both and explain which is more reliable.
- Default to primary sources when available.
